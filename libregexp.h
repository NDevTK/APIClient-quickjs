/* ---- One MATCH, suspendably. ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   lre_exec_backtrack's interpreter loop never recursed — it has always been an explicit backtracking stack —
   but "does not recurse" is not "can be interrupted". Its position (the regexp program counter, the input
   cursor, and the two offsets into the backtracking stack) lived in C locals, so a catastrophically
   backtracking pattern — the ReDoS shape, `/(a+)+b/.exec("a".repeat(40))` — held the thread from the first
   opcode to the last. Those four live on the CONTEXT, which the CALLER owns, and the loop's back-edges
   (REOP_goto, the loop opcodes, and the backtrack pop) are suspension points.

   lre_exec_begin seeds a match, lre_exec_step runs it until it finishes or the host asks for the thread back
   (LRE_RET_YIELD — call again and it continues at the exact opcode, never re-matching), lre_exec_end releases
   the stack. There is deliberately NO run-to-completion entry: a caller that cannot park is a caller that has
   not been routed yet, and one would be the second driver that hides that. */
/* The context is DEFINED here rather than inside libregexp.c because the caller now owns it: a suspended
   match's state has to outlive the frame that began it, and by value is the arrangement with no second
   allocation to lose — static_stack_buf exists precisely so an ordinary match allocates nothing. */
