/* THE STEP-MACHINE DECLARATION SURFACE — public, so a HOST component can declare one.
 *
 * A continuation-holding builtin is a step machine in this engine: it declares itself at its definition
 * (JS_CFUNC_STEP_DEF) and is driven from the one convergence point every call shape reaches, so its callback's
 * body suspends and resumes at any depth. Everything needed to WRITE one lived in quickjs.c, which meant only
 * quickjs.c could write one — and a browser component under engine/host/browser was therefore forced to read
 * its Web IDL arguments with JS_GetPropertyStr from C. That is page code running with no flow base, which is
 * exactly what the twelve internal-method entries abort on: core/fetch/fetch.c hit it on
 * `fetch(new Proxy({url:"/q"}, {get(){}}))` the first time it ran, and every component after it would have.
 *
 * These three types are that surface, moved here unchanged. The types their operations name that remain
 * internal (StringBuffer, ValueSlot, JSMapRecord, REExecContext) are forward tags: a machine passes them
 * through, it never opens them. */

       branch inside a callback forks the flow at that depth and `[1,2].forEach(e => cfg.admin ? … : …)` must
       not leave two arms sharing one cursor and one result array). Written as two lists they have already

       three of its five fields borrowed — which is what ITERCONS_OWNED and AFS_OWNED were each written to stop
       locally and what this stops everywhere.
       THE TEARDOWN DISCHARGES IT ITSELF — a machine never asks for that and never can. It used to: 137 engine
       finis ended in a `tramp_step_visit_free(ctx, s)` and 46 host teardowns restated the whole list by hand,
       which is 183 copies of one question, each of them a place for the answer to go missing (querySelectorAll's
       collected matches were named here and freed by nothing, and every abandoned selector walk leaked its
       element wrappers). The same move fixed a leak nothing could see: the engine's finis each freed the state
       block and the host's never did, because a step state is plain memory that no gc walk and no refcount
       report can name. One allocation site, one free site, one discharge.

       visited, or the clone over-counts and the teardown over-frees. Ownership that is conditional is an `if`
       around the visit, which is why this is a function and not a table of offsets — the TypedArray-filter
       writeback owns three cb slots and only while that call is in flight.

    /* WHICH ALGORITHM THIS MACHINE IS, AND WHICH OF ITS STEPS EACH STAGE NAMES.
     *
     * `stage` was documented as "the machine numbers the rest however it likes", and that is the whole of the
     * problem: a stage is where a machine RESTS — where it parks, where a sibling flow overtakes it, where a
     * cold-tier resume picks it up — and a private integer says nothing about where in the algorithm that is.
     * Two spec steps bundled into one stage are two steps between which this engine cannot suspend, which is
     * exactly the skipped logic the design forbids, and nothing could see it because the machine's own numbers
     * were internally consistent either way.
     *
     * AND THE PAGE IS NOT WHAT DECIDES WHICH STEPS MAY SHARE ONE. A stage boundary is a rest point because the
     * ENGINE may need to park there — RAM pressure paging the low-value tail to the IDB cold tier, a
     * cross-session resume, a flow that outranks this one — and not one of those events consults the page. So
     * the page can neither create a rest point nor remove one, and "no page code can run between these steps"
     * justifies NOTHING: a stage that bundles a span because the page happens to be quiet across it is a
     * stretch of algorithm this engine cannot park inside, which is a cap wearing a justification. It is the
     * same claim JS_STEP_YIELD already refuses one screen down — running no user code is not what makes a C
     * body safe to leave un-parkable, being O(1) is.
     * So a stage names ONE spec step. A label may name a RANGE only when the whole range is ONE O(1) ENGINE
     * action — a computation nothing the page controls can grow — and then the label says the range in those
     * terms. A span over anything of the PAGE'S SIZE (a list, a tree, a string, a collection, a parse) is not
     * a range at all: it is a stage per step, and the stage that walks returns JS_STEP_YIELD at every turn, so
     * the scheduler is ASKED at each one and answers from the frontier rather than from the algorithm.
     * js_step_def_check holds a declaration to the half a declaration can be held to: a label may not argue
     * from the page's code or the user's code at all. The label's job is to NAME the step, and the moment it
     * argues that a span is one stage the page has become the criterion — which is the reasoning this forbids,
     * and which every bundle found so far had written into its own label before it was acted on.
     *
     * `steps[stage]` is the spec step that stage rests at, as the standard writes it ("22.2.7.2 step 2"). That
     * makes a resume point EXACT rather than approximate: the driver asserts that a machine only ever rests at
     * a step of its own algorithm, a parked machine can SAY where it is parked, and a stage number means the
     * same thing in the next session as in this one — which is what a cross-session resume of a suspended
     * machine requires and what a private counter can never give it.
     *
     * NULL-terminated, indexed by stage, so a stage past the end is a machine that invented one. BOTH ARE
     * MANDATORY: this said "a definition that has not been converted yet declares neither, and the count of
     * those is the conversion's work queue" and pointed at a build gate that reports it. The gate does not
     * exist — it named one that had already been deleted — and the queue is empty, so what the sentence
     * actually described was an exemption with nothing left to exempt and nothing watching it. Every definition
     * now declares both, asserted where a def enters the runtime (JS_RegisterStepDef for a host component's,
     * js_step_defs_check_table for the engine's own) rather than counted anywhere; the conditional that used to
     * skip step_stage_check for an undeclared def is gone with it, because a guard whose false arm checks
     * nothing is how a machine that LOSES its declaration goes on resting wherever it likes.
     *
     * THE LABEL IS THE STAGE'S IDENTITY; THE INDEX IS ONLY THIS BUILD'S NAME FOR IT — and that is why the two
     * are ONE declaration (JS_STEP_STAGES below) rather than an enum beside an array. Written apart they are
     * two statements of one fact: RegExpBuiltinExec had eight constants and eight strings, and inserting a step
     * into one and not the other renames every stage after it, so `steps[stage]` names the wrong step and the
     * numbers still agree with themselves. The old defence was to number a stage OUT of sequence rather than
     * renumber the tail, which is a workaround for a drift the single declaration makes impossible.
     * ACROSS BUILDS the index cannot be the identity at all: a flow parked at stage 5 and resumed by a build
     * whose stages moved resumes at a different step of its algorithm, silently. So a parked machine's rest
     * point is its LABEL, and a resume RESOLVES that label back to an index in the build doing the resuming —
     * which is also why two stages may not declare the same label — asserted over the WHOLE list where a
     * definition enters the runtime (js_step_labels_check), and not at a rest, because a duplicate is ambiguous
     * whether or not a flow ever parks at it and asking only at a rest leaves it silent until one does.
     * A build-version stamp is the wrong answer to the same question: it rejects every parked snapshot whenever
     * ANY machine changes, and §scheduler's frontier never drops a work item. */

    /* WHY THIS MACHINE MUST NOT BE FORKED IN THE STATE IT IS IN NOW — the reason, or NULL when it may be.
     *
     * THIS CAPABILITY EXISTED AND WAS LOST, and getting it back is what this field is. `visit` used to carry
     * it as a side effect of being optional: a machine that declared none could not be cloned, and the fork
     * said so instead of handing two flows one state. Then the teardown started reading `visit` as the
     * ownership list, which made it MANDATORY — and a machine that owns JSValues AND must not be forked in
     * some states had no way left to say the second half.
     *
     * THE ONE MACHINE THAT NEEDS IT HOLDS A LEXBOR HTML PARSER. "C state cannot be forked" is not the reason
     * and is not true — cow_capture_host_record exists precisely so a component's C record time-travels. What
     * has no halves is specifically a tokenizer standing at a position, with an open-element stack and an
     * insertion mode behind it, and lexbor exposes no copy of one.
     *
     * IT IS ALSO NOT A LICENCE, AND ITS ONLY CORRECT TRAJECTORY IS TO ZERO. There were two declarers; the
     * selector walk was the other, and its reason turned out to be false — the CSS parser it held had finished
     * compiling before the machine's first rest point, and the matching context it held cleans itself at the
     * end of every match, so neither was state and neither belonged to the machine. Both moved to
     * core/dom/selector_match.c and the declaration went with them. A reason phrased as "no page code can run
     * here, so no fork can arrive" is the tell that the same mistake is being made again: parkability is a
     * property of the ENGINE, and RAM pressure, cold-tier eviction and a cross-session resume never ask what
     * the page is doing.
     *
     * IT IS A PREDICATE AND NOT A FLAG because the answer is about the STATE, not the definition: the same
     * machine is forkable before it builds its parser and unforkable while it holds one. And it is asked at
     * the FORK, which is the only consumer the answer is about. It must NOT be asserted inside `visit` — see
     * JSStepVisit's accumulator note: a machine must never learn which consumer is visiting it, and a `visit`
     * that DCHECKs "I was forked" fires on the teardown and on the fingerprint too, reporting an ordinary
     * abandoned walk as a fork. That is not hypothetical; it is what both of these did.
     *
     * The reason is the machine's own words and it is what the fork's abort prints, so the message names the
     * object rather than the mechanism. Zero for a machine that may always be forked. */

 * guard fired on the FIRST entry. §7.2.5's serialization, its URL parse and BOTH of its SecurityError refusals
 * were jumped over into a §7.4.4 work record nobody had begun. It compiled, and it would have aborted three
 * files away in a DCHECK reading "no entry — _begin builds it and must run first", with nothing pointing here.
 *   core/frame/session_history.c spelled its resume guard as a NEGATION — `if (a->stage != SH_APPLY_POPSTATE)`,
 * "anything but the last stage". Correct while §7.4.6.1 had two rest points; it gained a third and the negation
 * swallowed it, re-running ACTIVATE HISTORY ENTRY on every resume through the new stage. The symptom would have
 * been WORSE than the bug: the afterPotentialUnloads DCHECK firing on the resume, reporting "a SECOND history
 * step was applied across this one" and sending its reader to build §7.4.1.3's traversal queue for a race that
 * never happened. A correct assert pointing confidently at the wrong subsystem.
 *
 * A RESUME GUARD SPELLED AS A NEGATION IS WRONG FOR EVERY STAGE ADDED AFTER IT, and a positive one that names
 * only some of the stages is wrong for every stage added after it too — the arm it does not name falls into a
 * neighbour, and the neighbour is a REAL body running at the wrong step, which is why neither instance looked
 * like a bug at the site. So the body does not write the test at all:
 *
 *     STEP_DISPATCH(HPR_STAGES, hdr->stage, hdr->def->algorithm, JS_STEP_ABRUPT);
 *
 *     STEP_ARM(HPR_CHECKS);
 *         ... steps 1-9 ...
 *         STEP_GOTO(hdr->stage, HPR_UPDATE, NULL);
 *         return JS_STEP_YIELD;
 *
 *     STEP_ARM(HPR_UPDATE);
 *         ... step 10 ...
 *
 * WHAT IT MAKES IMPOSSIBLE, and each of these is a compiler diagnostic and not a runtime one:
 *   - a stage added to the list with no arm — the generated `goto step_arm_<name>` names a label that does not
 *     exist, which is a hard error in every C compiler regardless of the build's warning flags (this project
 *     compiles with -Wno-unused, so an unused-label warning would have been silently discarded);
 *   - an arm whose name is not a stage of this list — STEP_ARM evaluates the enumerator, so a typo is an
 *     undeclared identifier;
 *   - two stages sharing one constant — duplicate case value.
 * AND WHAT IT MAKES UNWRITABLE IS THE PART THAT MATTERS: there is no `else`, so a stage's body cannot live in
 * the un-named span between the function's first line and the first test. That span is where history.c's steps
 * 1-9 were sitting, reachable only by falling past a guard, and it is the only place a stage's body can hide.
 * Code that legitimately runs on EVERY entry stays above the dispatch, which is a statement about it rather
 * than an accident of where the guards happened to land.
 *
 * A ONE-ENTRY STAGE LIST IS NOT REFUSED, and refusing it would be the wrong repair for that first instance. A
 * machine whose algorithm IS one spec step has one rest point, and its suspensions are its REQUESTS, which
 * resume at that same stage through their own two-phase cursor — so a second stage forced on it would be a
 * label naming no step, which js_step_def_check exists to refuse. What was wrong in history.c was not the
 * count: it was that step 10 was declared and steps 1-9 were not, while the guard read the one declared
 * constant as though it were the SECOND of two. `stage == <the first constant>` is TRUE ON ENTRY and that is
 * correct — the first stage IS the entry stage — so the question a machine can never answer from its stage is
 * "have I started?", and a machine that needs one keeps its own byte (core/file/file_picker.c's `started`).
 * The dispatch is what makes the confusion unwritable, because the arm the guard was really selecting against
 * had nowhere left to live.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A SWITCH THE BODY WRITES. A hand-written `switch (hdr->stage)` over the same constants is the same
 * shape one edit away from the same bug: it is a second statement of the stage list, and the list is what
 * drifted in both instances. Generated from the declaration there is one list.
 *
 * `algorithm` IS THE MACHINE'S OWN NAME FOR ITSELF — `hdr->def->algorithm` wherever a header is in hand, so the
 * abort names the algorithm without a second copy of the string. A WORK RECORD carrying its own stage
 * (core/frame/session_history.c's SHApply, core/events/report_exception.c's) has no header and passes its
 * algorithm's name directly; the macro takes the stage as an LVALUE EXPRESSION for the same reason STEP_GOTO
 * does — the invariant is about the cursor, not about who owns it.
 *
 * `undeclared` IS WHAT A RELEASE BUILD RETURNS, and it is a parameter because omitting it is the bug wearing
 * its own uniform: DFAIL compiles out in release, so a dispatch that merely aborted in dev would, in release,
 * fall straight out of the switch into the FIRST ARM — a machine entered at a stage it does not declare running
 * the body of a step it is not at. The macro returns instead, so the two builds disagree about the diagnostic
 * and never about the control flow.
 *
 * A MACRO RATHER THAN A FUNCTION, for STEP_GOTO's reason: DCHECK/DFAIL stamp the file and line they are WRITTEN
 * at, so a helper here would report this header at every abort and say nothing about which machine was entered
 * where. DFAIL is therefore the CALLER's — engine/host/check.h in a host component, quickjs-check.h in the
 * engine — which is also why this header must not include either. */

       snapshots: the op string commonly lives on the MACHINE'S OWN state (a per-position buffer that carries an
       index), so the clone's copy is at a different address and a flow rebuilt from the cold tier has no
       address at all. The bytes are the only thing that is the same question in every tier. Zero is "nothing
       asked", which a js_mallocz'd state already reads as. */

    /* WHICH STAGE ISSUED THE FORK THAT IS OUTSTANDING — req_stage's argument, made of the one request kind that
       did not have it, and made because the key above CANNOT ANSWER THIS QUESTION AND WAS BEING ASKED IT.
       An ask key names the QUESTION and a resume needs the SITE, which are two questions over one string —
       and they agree at every machine until one algorithm asks ONE predicate at TWO of its own call sites. Then
       the stricter question decides the string and the looser one loses in silence, which is exactly what an
       elimination chain does: its key is composed from the PREDICATE and the member's own name, deliberately
       carrying neither the algorithm nor the operand (so that two members reached over one unknown agree), so
       an algorithm running the chain TWICE over TWO operands spells the SAME BYTES at the same position in
       both. DOM §4.10 Interface CharacterData's `substringData(offset, count)` is that algorithm: with both
       operands unknown it draws Web IDL §3.2.4.6's chain over `offset` and then again over `count`, and at the
       position where the two chains stand on the same number the ask key hashes identically — so the re-entry
       that follows the `count` chain's park re-asks the ANSWERED `offset` chain, the key check agrees, and one
       question's world is filed as another's with every arm real and in range.
       THE STAGE IS WHAT TELLS THEM APART, for the reason req_stage gives one paragraph down: a machine that has
       not moved is at the site that parked, and a stage is the resume point the driver already checks and a
       parked flow already says out loud. It is WRITTEN ON EVERY ASK and cleared with `fork_ask_key`, so the two
       halves of one outstanding question are set and reset together and a stale stage cannot outlive the key
       that names its question.
       NAMED RESIDUAL — TWO ASKS AT ONE STAGE OVER TWO OPERANDS SPELLING ONE OPERATION STRING ARE STILL ONE
       QUESTION TO BOTH HALVES OF THIS CHECK, and that is narrower than the invariant rather than wrong: an
       algorithm whose two sub-sequences can be in flight across a re-entry is one whose resume point is a
       STAGE, which is what the check above requires of it, and no algorithm in this engine asks that shape at
       one stage today (§5.1's two asks off one phase byte spell two operation strings over ONE operand, so the
       key tells them apart; §4.10's two chains spell one string over two operands and are now two stages).
       WHAT THE NEXT DIFF BUILDS: an OPERAND-IDENTITY accessor on JSConcolicHooks — the table carries `is`,
       `example` and `lead` and NOTHING that names a value, which is why step_fork_key can only reach the
       operation string — folded into that hash beside the op, so an ask is keyed by the predicate's own
       identity (operator AND operand) exactly as the constraint the seam files under it already is.
       HOW ITS ABSENCE SHOWS: an algorithm that grows a second sub-sequence over a second unknown at ONE stage
       consumes the first's arm at the second's call site with every assert on the path satisfied — the arm is
       real, in range, and recorded under the other operand's key — and the symptom is a report in which two
       unknowns of one call carry one unknown's narrowing. */

    /* WHICH STAGE ISSUED THE KEYED REQUEST THAT IS IN FLIGHT — the half of the two-phase contract that was
       missing, and the half that makes a keyed resume EXACT rather than merely plausible.
       A keyed sub-sequence parks on its first call and answers on its second, and the answering branch TAKES
       the value — so the second call has to be the same call site. That was checked by the KEY, and a key names
       the PROPERTY rather than the site: two reads of the same key at two stages are indistinguishable by it
       (STEP_GOTO below says so in as many words: "only when the two call sites happen to name DIFFERENT keys;
       when they name the same one it says nothing"), the INDEX forms pass JS_ATOM_NULL and were checked by
       nothing at all, and the own-keys and own-descriptor requests carried no site check of any kind.
       The STAGE is what the algorithm already declares (JSTrampStepDef.steps) and it is exactly what tells two
       sites apart, because a machine that has not moved is at the site that parked. A request answered at a
       stage other than the one that asked is a resume continuing in a DIFFERENT STEP of the algorithm with
       another step's value in hand — the loss §Time-travel calls a cap, and the one the shutdown in Streams
       §4.9.1 "Working with readable streams" shipped: the pipe fulfilled with its destination still locked
       and nothing said so.
       ONE STAMP FOR THE THREE KEYED CURSORS rather than one each. They are in flight together only WITHIN one
       stage — Web IDL's record<> takes the key list and then reads each key — so an overlapping request issued
       at a DIFFERENT stage is refused where it is ISSUED, which names the machine that walked away from its
       own request instead of leaving a later end to read a stamp the newer request had overwritten. */

 * A host machine's teardown has two halves and the split between them is the whole point: the DECLARATION owns
 * every reference (discharged by JS_StepVisitFree), and the component's own `release` owns what the declaration
 * does not name — a lexbor handle, a foreign C allocation, a global flag the algorithm took and must give back
 * (§4.13.4 step 14's "regardless of whether the above steps threw", HTML §4.10.22.3 step 8's). `release` runs
 * FIRST and may READ an owned value, because those flags live on one.
 *
 * A `release` that FREES one is the second list growing back, and it is invisible either way it is written:
 * free-and-null leaves the visit's free a no-op, free-without-null makes the visit's free a double free. So the
 * teardown folds the declaration into this number before `release` and again after, and asserts they match.
 *
 * WHAT THE NUMBER IS MADE OF IS SLOT IDENTITY, NEVER A REFERENCE COUNT, and a caller has to know that to read
 * the assert it fires. The property is "the declaration still names what it named": free-and-null, replace and
 * hand-over all move it. Free-WITHOUT-null does not — it reaches the discharge as the second free and the
 * allocator answers there. A reference count would appear to close that gap and cannot: a count says how many
 * holders an object has and never WHICH, so a `release` giving back somebody else's reference to a declared
 * object moves it exactly as a `release` discharging the declaration does, and where the slot is the sole
 * holder the count can only be read out of a block the offending `release` has already returned. So this
 * bracket does NOT forbid a `release` from moving reference counts elsewhere in the agent's object graph; it
 * forbids it from touching the slots the declaration names.
 *
 * EVERY operation is folded, not only the reference-holding ones. What `release` may own is what the
 * declaration does NOT name, and this walk reaches only what it DOES — so a `buf` named by the visit is the
 * declaration's allocation exactly as a `val` is its reference: the fork copies it with js_malloc and the
 * discharge frees it with js_free. Exempting those is how nine such buffers came to be freed by seven
 * `release` hooks and grown with the C library's realloc, which a fork would then have handed to the wrong

 * step_toint32_run, step_toint32sat_run, step_tofloat64_run) — never by a machine directly, and it is the
 * answer to ECMAScript §7.1.19 ToString ( arg ) and §7.1.4 ToNumber ( arg ) over UNKNOWN EXTERNAL INPUT.
 *
 * §7.1.19 step 9 asserts the remaining case is an Object and step 10 is `ToPrimitive(arg, string)`; §7.1.4
 * steps 7-8 are the same pair with hint `number`, which is why one mechanism answers both. §7.1.1
 * ToPrimitive ( input [ , preferredType ] ) over a concolic returns it unchanged — a concolic stands for a
 * value that IS primitive in the page and wears an Object only because the solver needs a carrier with an
 * exotic [[Get]] — so step 12's recursive ToString is a ToString over an unknown String, whose result is an
 * unknown String. The conversion BOUNDARY cannot answer that (JS_ToStringInternal owes C a real JSString and
 * says so), so the answer is given where the spec performs the coercion, which for every builtin that can run
 * the page's `toString` is this one shared sub-sequence.
 *
 * WHAT THE DRIVER DOES WITH IT: the machine's whole completion becomes a concolic DERIVED from the operand,
 * named by the algorithm and the spec step it was coercing at. That is the generalisation of a rule this file
 * already wrote by hand at Array.prototype.join — "an unknown element makes the whole join unknown", the
 * concrete prefix subsumed rather than kept, because a partial string is a value the page never computes and
 * the source identity is what a later sink solves for. Every value-producing algorithm has that shape: a
 * result computed out of a string nobody has is a result nobody has, and it keeps `src` and `root` so a branch
 * over it still forks and an @S candidate still injects at the source that fed it.
 *
 * A MACHINE WITH A MORE PRECISE ANSWER STATES IT AT ITS OWN SITE, and several already do — String.prototype.
 * concat folds an unknown piece through the `+` hook so the known literals survive, the Error constructor
 * defines the derived unknown as `message` and CARRIES ON building the error object, parseInt/parseFloat and
 * RegExp name their own operation. Those are not a fallback this selects against: they are the algorithm's own
 * semantics, and they run first because they are IN the algorithm. This is what an algorithm with nothing
 * better to say completes as, and there is nothing left for it to fall back TO.
 *
 * THAT ANSWER IS GIVEN IN ONE OF TWO PLACES, AND WHICH ONE IS DECIDED BY THE VALUE, NOT BY TASTE. The four
 * above ask BEFORE the coercion, because the operand they are looking at is the one the page handed them. A
 * machine whose operand may become unknown ONLY PART-WAY THROUGH the coercion cannot ask there: `cmp()` may
 * return an ordinary object whose `valueOf` answers with unknown external input, and §7.1.1 ToPrimitive
 * ( input [ , preferredType ] ) is what discovers that — one hop after the pre-check would have run. Such a
 * machine answers WHEN THE SUB-SEQUENCE REPORTS, by consuming JS_STEP_UNKNOWN instead of returning it, which
 * is the ONE site both ways in converge on. It then owns the parked operand, and STEP_UNKNOWN_ANSWERED is how
 * it gives it back. A pre-check ALONE is not a narrower version of this — it is a hole with a crash in it. */

/* LEAVING A STAGE WITH A REQUEST STILL IN FLIGHT IS THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR — every stage transition in a
 * machine that owns a request buffer goes through here.
 *
 * A request is TWO-PHASE: the stage that issues it is re-entered with its cursor at 1 and MUST reach the SAME
 * step_call_run / step_construct_run / step_getprop_run to collect the answer, because the cursor is what tells
 * that call site "you are the resume, take the value" rather than "ask". A stage that re-evaluates its decision
 * on the way back in can decide differently — the shutdown in Streams §4.9.1 "Working with readable streams"
 * did exactly that, since ISSUING the close is what made WritableStreamCloseQueuedOrInFlight true, so the
 * resume took the "already closing" branch
 * and walked away from its own call. The cursor stayed at 1, the NEXT stage's request read it as a resume and
 * took the abandoned call's result as its own, and `writer.releaseLock()` was never called at all: the pipe
 * fulfilled with the destination still locked. Nothing said so, because the value a stage received was a REAL
 * value — the other request's. quickjs.c's step_getprop_done DFAILs on the same event one step LATER, and only
 * when the two call sites happen to name DIFFERENT keys; when they name the same one it says nothing.
 *
 * The rule is structural, which is why it is a primitive and not a defence one component wrote for itself: a
 * stage's DECISION is made once, with every cursor at rest, and a stage that holds a request does nothing but
 * hold it. Aborting AT the transition names the stage that walked away, rather than the innocent stage three
 * transitions later whose request silently answered without asking.
 *
 * THE CURSOR LIST IS NULL-TERMINATED AND NAMES EVERY SUB-SEQUENCE THIS MACHINE CAN HAVE IN FLIGHT — its own
 * call/construct phase bytes, a sub-record's (`&s->w.phase`), and, for a machine whose requests are the keyed
 * ones, the header's own `&h->get_phase`. Listing them is the machine's statement of what it owns, in the same
 * spirit as `visit`: a machine that holds no request buffer at all lists none and assigns its stage directly,
 * because there is no cursor to leave behind and a fabricated one would assert nothing. The list is where the
 * cursor goes the day such a machine grows one.
 *
 * `dst` IS THE STAGE LVALUE, NOT A HEADER, because the invariant is about the cursor and not about who owns the
 * stage: a WORK RECORD a machine suspends inside (AbortSignalWork's §3.2 walk, report_exception's) carries a
 * stage and a phase of its own and needs exactly this over them.
 *
 * A MACRO RATHER THAN AN INLINE FUNCTION, for the reason the whole assert exists: DCHECK stamps the file and
 * line it is WRITTEN at, so a function here would report this header at every abort and say nothing about which
 * transition walked away. Expanding at the call site is what makes the message the answer. DCHECK itself is
 * therefore the caller's — engine/host/check.h in a host component, quickjs-check.h in the engine — which is
 * also why this header must not include either of them. */
/* IT ASKS ABOUT A TRANSITION, AND A WRITE THAT CHANGES NOTHING IS NOT ONE. The invariant is that the NEXT
 * stage's request site must not collect THIS one's answer; when the stage does not move there is no next site,
 * the same site resumes and collects its own. Restricting the question that way is not a softening — it is the
 * invariant stated exactly — and the case it admits is the ordinary shape of a machine that loops over a pair:
 * readable_stream.c's tee derives its index FROM the stage (`i = s->hdr.stage == TS_B1`) and re-enters the loop
 * body on every resume, so its first statement rewrote the stage it already held while `tee_ctrl_run`'s cursor
 * was legitimately mid-flight. That fired on the smoke fixture, and the machine was right: nothing had moved.
 * Written as a comparison against `to` rather than as a "resuming?" flag, because a flag would be the machine
 * telling the assert when not to run, which is the recognizer shape this file bans everywhere else. */
/* AND THE SCAN IS BOUNDED BY THE ARRAY'S OWN SIZE, NEVER BY THE TERMINATOR IT IS LOOKING FOR — because the
 * terminator is a thing a CALL SITE supplies, and a scan that trusts it to be there reads past the end of the
 * array the moment one site forgets. That is not a diagnostic that degrades: reading `rest_[n]` off an
 * n-element automatic array is undefined behaviour, and an optimising compiler is entitled to conclude the loop
 * never exits and to emit the infinite jump that says so. It did — one `[PutForwards]` transition, written with
 * its cursor and no terminator, compiled at -O1 into a two-byte `jmp .` INSIDE the step body, so every
 * assignment through that binding (`el.style = …`, `rule.media = …`, `window.location = …`) burned the whole
 * CPU budget in ONE C activation with the interpreter never getting control back — the drive-to-completion this
 * file's every other rule exists to prevent, arrived through a missing comma-NULL rather than through a loop
 * anybody wrote. THE SIZE IS KNOWN AT THE EXPANSION, so the bound is the size; the terminator stays the
 * convention every site already writes, and its ABSENCE is now a named abort at the site that forgot it instead
 * of a program the compiler is free to reshape. Asked before the transition test, because a malformed list is

 * A bytecode branch forks because the interpreter has everything a fork needs at an OP_if: a condition, a pc
 * to resume the sibling at, a frame to snapshot. A C builtin whose result DEPENDS ON UNKNOWN INPUT has the
 * same decision and none of those things — `JSON.parse(text)` over unknown text completes with a value or with
 * a SyntaxError, both feasible, and a builtin that picks one has DELETED the other arm, which is exactly the
 * arm a `catch` reaches and a sink lives behind. So the machine declares the fork instead, and the driver
 * snapshots the whole flow AT the machine (the machine's own state included, cloned through its `visit`) so
 * the sibling RESUMES here with the other outcome. It is a snapshot, never a replay.
 *
 * `over` is the unknown operand the outcome depends on and `op` names the operation; together they are the
 * constraint key, which the SOLVER builds — the engine states the question, never the policy. `n` is how many
 * completions the machine declares feasible; which one means "threw" is a fact about the algorithm and stays
 * the machine's own, with ONE rule on the numbering: OUTCOME 0 IS THE ONE A RUN WITH NO FORKING POLICY TAKES.
 * A machine therefore numbers its ordinary completion first, because the @S candidate re-fire runs ONE
 * concrete path and must not be diverted down an exceptional arm on its way to the sink.
 *
 * `real` IS THE MACHINE'S SECOND DECLARATION AND IT IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM THE NUMBERING ABOVE: not
 * "which completion does a run with no forking policy take" but "which completion does THIS operation reach
 * when run on the operand's EXAMPLE" — the concrete value the run already carries. A branch gets that answer
 * from the condition's own example; an outcome's arms are not booleans, so the seam that holds the operand and
 * the operation's NAME cannot compute it and must not guess it from the name. The machine can, because it owns
 * the semantics, and it says so HERE rather than anywhere else so that the two declarations sit together and
 * neither can be added without the other being visible. JS_OUTCOME_REAL_UNSTATED (quickjs.h) is what a machine
 * passes when it cannot say — an operand carrying no example, an operation whose completion over one is not
 * computable here — and it is a positive statement: the fork still happens, both arms still run, and neither
 * is marked forced. Stating it is what makes the ordinary completion the PRIMARY arm and a forced one as
 * visible in a request's provenance as a forced branch already is.
 *
 * Returns JS_STEP_FORK (the caller returns it — the state must be complete-or-empty at that point, since the
 * SIBLING'S SNAPSHOT IS TAKEN THERE), or 0 once *parm is this flow's outcome. Both a park and a cross-session

 * answer from the value's TYPE, an unknown rides an ordinary Object, and step 4 returns true for every one. So

 * say so, and the rule that both arms run wherever the domain permits both of them false of the commonest
 * predicate a real bundle writes. It is the identical defect the `!` operator had, one layer out: a coercion
 * that answers from the REPRESENTATION deletes an arm silently, wherever it is performed.
 *
 * THE ANSWER IS THE BRANCH SEAM AND NOT THE OUTCOME SEAM, and that is the whole of the design — see
 * JSStepHdr.fork_kind. A ToBoolean is the same predicate `if (p)` asks about, so it is keyed by the VALUE'S OWN
 * branch identity and it records what a branch records (the pin, the excluded token, the bound, the call
 * predicate). The outcome seam keys by (operand, OPERATION, completion), which is right for a machine asking
 * which of ITS completions it reaches and wrong here twice over: it would fork a second time over a predicate
 * the flow may already have fixed, and it would file a domain-less shape for a parameter the page had gated.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A SECOND SPELLING OF JSConcolicHooks.to_bool, WHICH MINTS A VALUE. `to_bool` exists because a
 * program HOLDS the boolean (`var q = !p`), so `!p` needs an identity of its own or `"" + !p` and `"" + p`
 * compose to one derivation. A machine that only needs a C `int` to branch on holds no value and mints none —
 * exactly as OP_if_false hands its operand straight to the branch hook while OP_lnot is the one that mints.
 *
 * `op` NAMES THE ASK ON THIS MACHINE AND IS NOT THE CONSTRAINT KEY. The key is the operand's, above; this is
 * what `fork_ask_key` hashes, so a machine with two ToBoolean asks cannot consume one's answer at the other's
 * call site. A machine with one ask names its coercion and is done.
 *
 * `v` is BORROWED for the length of the request, exactly as step_fork_run's `over` is, so the caller must hold
 * it somewhere THE SNAPSHOT CARRIES — its own state, reached by its `visit` — and not in a C local. A value
 * that is not unknown input is answered HERE with the ordinary §7.1.2 and no fork, which is why this has no
 * predicate at its call sites: there is no second path for one to select.
 *
 * Returns JS_STEP_FORK (the caller returns it; the state must be complete-or-empty, since the sibling's
 * snapshot is taken there), or 0 once *pres is 0 or 1.
 *
 * RESIDUAL — WHAT IS NOT COVERED. The array-callback walk (every/some/filter and their %TypedArray% twins) is
 * the only consumer. Every other C body that coerces a value the PAGE produced still answers from §7.1.2's own
 * steps and therefore takes `true` for unknown input: the find family (Array find/findIndex/findLast/
 * findLastIndex and their four %TypedArray% twins — EIGHT builtins sharing one machine, which is the number
 * that matters, since routing the machine covers all of them), the Iterator helper `filter` predicate, the
 * eager iterator terminals (`some`/`every`/`find` over an iterator), and the internal-method booleans a Proxy
 * trap returns ([[Has]], [[Set]], [[DefineOwnProperty]], [[PreventExtensions]], [[SetPrototypeOf]],
 * [[IsExtensible]]).
 *
 * WHAT THE NEXT DIFF BUILDS. The find machine alone is routable as this one was: its state begins with a
 * JSStepHdr, so it needs a held-operand field of its own (JSArrayEvery.test's shape and sentinel) and its
 * predicate-test branch calling this. The two ITERATOR families are NOT — their records carry no JSStepHdr at
 * all, so they have no fork seam to reach and the diff that covers them is the one that gives them one; naming
 * them here without that distinction would send the next reader to add a call where there is no header to pass.
 *
 * HOW ITS ABSENCE WOULD SHOW. `[{}].find(x => x.isAdmin)` over unknown input answers with the element and
 * forks nothing, where the same predicate written as `for (…) if (x.isAdmin)` forks two worlds — one builtin
 * and its hand-written equivalent disagreeing about the same program, which is exactly the divergence the
 * solver differential is built to fail on. */

/* ToString AS A REQUEST — the coercion nearly every Web IDL argument actually is. `DOMString type`,
   `DOMString name`, `DOMString selector`: each is ToString on whatever the page passed, so
   `el.addEventListener({toString(){ for(;;){} }}, f)` is the page's loop. Without this a component's only
   honest move was JS_ToCString from C, which in this engine does not quietly misbehave — it reaches
   JS_ToPrimitiveFree's DFAIL and aborts, naming the site — but aborting is where a capability is missing, not
   where it is built. Returns JS_STEP_REQUEST (the caller returns it), 0 once *pout is set, or -1.
   …OR JS_STEP_UNKNOWN, when the value being coerced is UNKNOWN EXTERNAL INPUT and §7.1.19 ToString ( arg )
   therefore has no String to produce. Nothing is written to *pout on that path; the caller returns the code
   like any other positive one — which every call site already does, because that is what parking on a request
   has always meant — and the driver completes the machine with the derived unknown. See JS_STEP_UNKNOWN. */
